# VisualNBA
Data visualization for NBA stats


This aim of this project is to create a web application that showcases many different NBA statistical visualizations using data pulled from nba.com. This application will also integrate with Google Home using the Google Actions SDK to provide audio responses to voice queries.

The backend will be coded in Python, using the Django framework , with the frontend being written in JavaScript, using frameworks such as React and D3.js. MySQL will be used to manage database access.
